abstract = "Three kinds of evidence indicate that desert rodents and ants compete for seeds: (i) extensive overlaps in diet, (ii) reciprocal increases when one taxon is experimentally excluded, and (iii) complementay patterns of diversity and biomass in georadients of productivity. The effect on seed resources and annual plan geoseems to be similar whether rodents, ants, or both are foraging."
