The Portal Project is a long-term ecological study being conducted near Portal, AZ. Since 1977, the site has been used to study the interactions among rodents, ants and plants and their respective responses to climate. To study the interactions among organisms, we experimentally manipulate access to 24 study plots. This study has produced over 100 scientific papers and is one of the longest running ecological studies in the U.S.

Ecosystems are complex. They are comprised of species with divergent body sizes, generation times, and abilities to evolve in response to changed conditions. The abiotic environment (for example: temperature, humidity, etc) can  change from hour-to-hour, season-to-season, year-to-year, or exhibit decadal or longer cycles. This complexity creates a variety of ecological dynamics on short-, medium-, long-, and even geologic time scales. While long-term studies have become more common, it is undoubtedly true that most studies greater than 50 years are still not the result of direct observation. This means we continue to have little or no idea what the long-term responses of ecosystems may be to perturbations.

Studies like the Portal Project are critical to our understanding of how seemingly simple manipulations can result in complex and unexpected long-term dynamics. For over 40 years we have been monitoring a 20 ha piece of the Chihuahuan Desert and observing its continually surprising response to the removal of dominant species.
