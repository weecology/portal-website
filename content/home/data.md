We monitor rodents, plants, ants, and weather. All data from the Portal Project are made openly available in near real-time so that they can provide the maximum benefit to scientific research and outreach. The core dataset is managed using an [automated living data workflow](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/12/344804) run using GitHub and Continuous Analysis.

The Portal Project data can also be accessed through the Data Retriever, a package manager for data.

A teaching focused version of the dataset is also maintained with some of the complexities of the data removed to make it easy to use for computational training purposes. This dataset serves as the core dataset for the Data Carpentry Ecology material and has been downloaded almost 50,000 times.
