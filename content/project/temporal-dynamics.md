Nature is always changing, but we understand little about the dynamics of how 
ecological systems undergo change or its impact on the function of those systems. 
Inspired by our challenges understanding the group's long-term study system, a major 
focus of our group is studying the temporal dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. 
Quantifying ecological dynamics is difficult and we are not just studying ecological change, 
we are also exploring new tools for studying ecological dynamics. Our hope is that by 
understanding the patterns that emerge as ecological system change, and the underlying 
operating processes, we will improve our ability to forecast future change.
